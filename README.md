### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The purpose of this project is to explore and analyse the data from a bikeshare system for three major cities in the United States of America. Namely, Chaicago, New York City and Washington. The bikeshare system is a system that consists of data related to renting out of bicycles to customers to commute to and/ or from different stations. This project analyses the data from the above-mentioned cities to compute descriptive statistics relating to the usage of the bicycles by different customer in each of the cities.

The user can choose any city to analyse, and then choose whether to analyse the data by one of the following months [January, February, March, April, May or June] or they may choose to analyse the data across all the months, and lastly, they can choose to analyse by any day of the week or by all the days of the week. The descriptive statistics that will be the output of the analysis will include any of the following depending on the user input:

-The most frequent times of travel
-The most popular start and end stations, and the most popular trip
-The trips durations  
-The users statistics
-The raw data used to perform the analysis
